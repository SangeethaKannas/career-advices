#1. Buy experiences not things

Experts believe that spending money on experiences such as a vacation or adventure sports, produces happiness that lasts longer compared to spending the same money on physical things. The reasoning is that experiences stay in the memory longer, and can’t be compared with someone else’s experience.

So the next time you want to remember fondly what you spent your money on, try a road trip instead of a new smartphone whose technology will be obsolete in less than a year.

#2. Spend on others

Research has found that spending money on others, generally friends or family, helps you derive greater happiness as compared to spending on yourself. So treat your loved ones to a great gift and let their happiness add to your own.

Giving to charity and sharing your wealth with those who need help, is another great way to derive meaningful joy.

#3. Buy happiness in bite sized pieces

Small indulgences such as a one off ice-cream or even a head massage the next time you go to a hair salon are likely to give you greater joy than a one-off big ticket purchase. The key is to go for small things that give you several small bursts of happiness.

#4. Buy what you like, not to keep up with others

Buying based on what you like versus trying to keep up with your peers has been shown to provide greater joy. Your individuality, when it reflects in the things you buy, tends to bring greater satisfaction to you.

#5. Buy more free time

Spend on outsourcing things which save you time such as on hiring a maid or a cook. You will have more time to spend on things you like to do rather than boring chores which you would rather avoid.

#6. Spend on your passion or hobbies

Spending on something you enjoy doing, such as spending on a sports club membership, Lego sets, or even video games, can directly enhance your happiness.

### Experience
The first time nearbuy went to hire from ISB, we had to find a way of creating a buzz on the campus.

We weren’t a well known brand. And competition for talent was intense.

So during the pre-placement talk, we told students three things.

1. Your resume SHOULD NOT be in the ISB resume template.
2. Add color to your resume.
3. On the resume, name someone else from the batch who you think is better than you, for the role you are applying for.

It was super interesting to see the reactions.

1. While some students were relieved that they did not have to follow the template, some were jittery. Because now there was no standard way of doing the task!
2. Almost everyone was curious as to “what does color mean?” This led to the most joyful submissions: PDFs. Comic books. Highlights.
We sensed liberation!

3. We collated the frequently recurring names, and if they hadn’t applied reached out to them, while the submissions were on.

“7 students who have applied think you will be better than them at this role. Do you wish to consider applying?”
In a batch of 770 people, we had 380 students applying!
It made our job of shortlisting a lot harder, but we weren’t complaining.
This is what we signed up for!

We eventually hired 4 product managers. And all 4 of them stayed with us for 3+ years!

There is a thing about templates.
They are very seductive.
They give an illusion of safety.
They give an illusion of low risk.

So a lot of us fall for them.

Not just in our resumes.
In our lives.

Think about it.
How many of us are living our life like a template?

If Class tenth marks > 90%, then science
If parents = engineers, then engineering
If parents = business, then study commerce
If engineer = yes, then MBA
If age > 25, get married jaldi jaldi
If married > 2 years, sunao khushkhabri to the world

All of these are nothing but templates.

And whenever I think of templates, I am reminded of a powerful thing that Steve Jobs once said during an interview.

"Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use."

But most of us do not change the rules.

We play a game designed and rules laid out by someone else.
And thus the rules laid out by someone else.

The world does not need another template.
The world needs a rebel.

### Interview Rounds

Round 1: Few companies have first written round, comprising of MCQs on core Data Engineering topics like Spark, Hadoop, AWS/Azure/GCP, SQL, Hive, etc. along with a few coding questions.

Round 2: Primarily based on SQL. It included questions around-
• All types of Joins  
• Group By
• Indexing
• CASE-WHEN statement 
• Null-Safe Join
• CTE(Common Table Expressions)
• Dealing with duplicates
• Any, All, and exists
• Union operation, Subqueries, Having clause
• Windowing Functions like Rank (), Row_Number() & Dense_Rank()
• Over Clause with Partition and OrderBy
• Aggregation on windowing functions like SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() etc.

DSA is also one of the necessary skillsets for a Data Engineer. Can expect questions from basic/intermediate level on topics such as Array, String, Stack, Queue, Linked List, and Tree.

Round 3: Coding question on Python with a primary focus on Pandas and Data Structures such as List, Tuple, Set & Dictionary. Another important domain is Spark, with questions on-
• How Distributed computing works
• Spark Architecture
• MapReduce Vs Spark
• Catalyst Optimizer
• How driver works in cluster mode 
• RDD
• Lazy Evaluation
• Fault Tolerance in Spark
• Lineage Graph 
• Groupbykey and Reduceby key
• Persistence and Caching 
• Optimization in Spark
• How to tune a spark job
• Repartition and Coalesce
• Partitioning and Bucketing
• Narrow and Wide transformations

Round 4: Based on any cloud platform you are most familiar with. It included questions around-
• ETL and ELT architecture
• Schedule spark jobs using Databricks
• Azure Data Factory
• Integration runtime and linked Service
• Azure Data Lake
• SDLC
• Agile methodology 
• DevOps Strategy 
• CI/CD pipeline
• Git
• Database concepts
• Configuration of spark cluster in terms of executor memory, number of worker nodes, executors per worker nodes, cores per executor & driver memory.
• Working & internal lakehouse architecture of Databricks
• Batch processing & stream processing using Spark
• Big Data File Formats, Delta tables

These rounds were focused on data modeling, PySpark & ETL pipeline design.

Round 5(Hiring Manager Round): It comprised of low- and high-level system design questions like-
• Components
• Data warehouse structure
• Movement of data
• Tools you would use for Extraction, Transformation, and Loading of the data
• How to optimize the design with given constraints

Also, it had a High-level project discussion based on resume and previous work experience, tech stack used, challenges faced, How you solved those, What was your role in previous teams, etc.
