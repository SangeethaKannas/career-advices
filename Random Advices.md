◈ Recruiter Pre-screen (20-30 mins) - Initial screening based on resume. Questions related to your professional experience, noteworthy projects, and accomplishments. No coding.
 
◈ Technical Phone Interview (45-60 mins) – You will solve a coding question using an online editor. Your interviewer might ask you a follow-up question or add constraints to the current problem. Common topics include data structures, algorithms, and time/space complexity.  
 
◈ Onsite Loop (4-5 interviews) - Coding, design, and behavioral questions.
 ➡ Ninja (coding, 2 interviews) – 1-2 coding questions solved on a whiteboard in 45 mins.

At times all you need is not only to push yourself a little bit more, but to accept that you’re facing a burnout, a creative block, a gloomy day to not do anything else but to wake up & still make yourself a plate of good food, turn on your laptop just to browse through your emails & do nothing else… allow yourself a good afternoon nap on a Saturday afternoon & come back to LinkedIn to share your burnout with your connections!

Burnout is real. The only way to overcome is to accept it. Allow yourself a creative break. Sleep enough. Drink water. That’s it.
The 3 crucial lessons nobody taught me but I learnt with experience :

> Growth comes when you push yourself out of that comfort bubble. 
New things might seem daunting at times but that’s when you will accommodate your own abilities to fit in the new ones. 

> Your network can decide how far you go.
Your circle of people can define the motivation inside you, the goals you set, the vision you have. Everything is influenced. So, make sure it’s all influenced by the right people. 

> Self- worth is subjective. Not a metric for comparison.
A lot of variables contribute to your journey. You can’t compare each and everything. Accept the unique path you are on and move ahead taking inspiration from others’ journeys.

1. He was always punctual. I cannot remember a day that he was late even by a minute. He may come few minutes early but never late. Respect for time is very important to build a great reputation.

2. He was always regular. In 8 years, he has never taken a single day off. Very rarely he needs a leave but always informs well in advance. Commitment and dependability is very important in customer service.

3. Though he was from Orissa, he could cook all cuisines very well, specially South Indian. Having diverse skills is super important to last long in any business.

4. He never asked for a hike in all the years. Of course, we used to hike regularly but he never expressed any dissatisfaction in his salary or payments. His work was his top priority. It's not always that money can motivate performance. There has to be immense passion to be at your best.

5. He would always ask feedback. Everytime he did a new menu, he checked in if we liked it. Sometimes, when we have critical feedback for anything he cooked, he took it positively and tried to improve. Being open to constructive feedback is key to improve continuously. Also it's always important to collect feedback proactively.

1) Staying in your comfort zone.
2) Bad or a toxic circle
3) Negative mindset and limiting beliefs.
4) Herd Mentality.
5) Not investing enough in skill enhancement and learning.
6) Not focusing on Personal development and branding.

⭐️ Do less up-front: don't load latest content until needed by the user.
⭐️ Be really lazy: don't fetch more than needed content until the user needs them.
⭐️ Do as little as possible: don't pre-ready content unless user is highly likely to use it.
⭐️ Core user intent first: optimize for primary user scenario first, moving everything else out of the way.
⭐️ Be a step ahead of the user: using analytics to only prefetch the most likely next move of the user.

You might be wondering why there's a picture of a crocodile.

Fun facts: Crocodiles are considered to be one of the laziest and most energy efficient animals in the world. Some large salt-water crocs can last as much as a year without food and can drop their heart rate to as low as 2-3 beats per minute.

Consistent actions (short term) ⇒ Crack marketing channels for your startup (long term)

1. Write 1 post every day ⇒ Social media following

2. Publish 1 article every 2-3 days ⇒ Traffic via SEO

3. Write 1 newsletter every week ⇒ Email audience


Now, become obsessive about your time.
Do your work diligently, but spare as much time as you can after that. Your nights, weekends, holidays. Whatever you can manage.
And use that time to explore.
Explore different things that you feel you could be good at.

We mostly do it wrong.
We quit our jobs.
And put the pressure on a new thing to make us money.
When it is way too early for it to do so.

Enjoy the exploration.
And if you find that thing that you truly enjoy and are good at - you will eventually find a way to make money from it.

Which is when you can say no to your job.

What often comes as lack of clarity, goes away when we free ourselves from any pressure to make things work. Which is when things do work out!

How to kill a LION (Corporate Style)

1. Pfizer method:

Hire a lion, give him full rest, pay him more than his expectations, and never ask for anything in the first 2 months. After 2 months tell him that you have to achieve your yearly target in 9 months, lion dies of fear that if he does not achieve this he will be lost in the jungle.

2. Amazon method:

Hire a lion, give him a hell lot of work, and pay him a fat salary more than the industry. Restructure his job as per your fancies every 6 months. If he kills 2 goats a day, the next day gives him a target of killing 20 elephants a day while knowing that there are only 10 elephants available. Lion dies of exhaustion and overkill.

3. Zomato method:

Hire a lion and give him a post of a cat, then force the lion to meow like a cat. Give him lots of ESOPs and grass to eat. Lion will eventually die of hope and starvation.

4. JP Morgan method:

Hire a lion and give him a 3000-page circular on how to kill a goat. Amend the circular at least 3 times a week. Send the lion to the jungle to inspect how he can cancel the license of the fox, wolf, or jackal who has violated the 3000-page circular. Lion dies of stagnation and boredom.

5. Microsoft method:

Hire a lion and give him 60kg of meat to eat every day when he can eat only 30kg. Lion dies of overeating.

6. Google Method:

Recruit a lion, and ask him to kill an elephant without any cut or blood from the body. Lion is forced to learn from ducks, rabbits, and pigeons how to kill dinosaurs. Lion is provided with 2 wolves to help in killing but with a condition that the wolves will not move or attack. Lion dies of confusion and paradoxes.

7. Flipkart method:

Flipkart is out of the race and they are still thinking as to what is a lion?

8. Jio method:

Hire a lion and show him the forest from far. Keep moving the forest full of opportunities so he keeps running. He never gives up coz there are many like him running. Finally, he retires halfway or dies in the stampede.

9. SBI Method:

Hire a Lion, and give him the lowest possible salary and allowances. Start 3-4 campaigns at a single time. Give him unachievable targets. Don't give subordinates. Change software suddenly. Take meetings and threaten him to transfer to the remote branch. Lion dies cursing his bad luck!
